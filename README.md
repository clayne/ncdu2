ncdu2 v1.0
==========

DESCRIPTION

  ncdu2 (NCurses Disk Usage) is a curses-based version of
  the well-known 'du', and provides a fast way to see what
  directories are using your disk space.
  ncdu2 is based on ncdu 1.14.1 at git://g.blicky.net/ncdu.git
  
DIFFERENCES FROM NCDU
  - Added user and groups columns. Possible to sort by users or groups 
    as the top-level sorting.
  - Added per-user stats (total usage, items) at each directory level.
  - Always shows stats for current user on bottom status line.
  - Added option to save report with list of current view. Report also
    lists stats for each user for the current folder tree.
  - Added parsing of date metadata of imported index file, and shows it
    as [imported YYYY-MM-DD] in upper right corner.
  - Remapped key mapping, and changed many defaults compared to ncdu.
  - Not possible to disable "extended info", also completely removed internally.
  - Added NCDUZ front-end script that eases import/export of gzipped index files.
    
REQUIREMENTS

  In order to compile and install ncdu, you need to have
  at least...

  - a POSIX-compliant operating system (Linux, BSD, etc)
  - curses libraries and header files


INSTALL

  The usual:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    make install

  If you're building directly from the git repository, make sure you have perl
  (or rather, pod2man), pkg-config and GNU autoconf/automake installed, then
  run 'autoreconf -i', and you're ready to continue with the usual ./configure
  and make route.
